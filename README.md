# FWI Prediction - Flask ML App

This is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using weather and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and other fire-related indices.

The model uses a Ridge Regression algorithm and a Standard Scaler for preprocessing, both of which are saved as `.pkl` files and loaded during runtime.

## ðŸ”¥ What is FWI?
The **Fire Weather Index** is a numerical rating of fire danger based on weather conditions. A higher FWI indicates higher potential for wildfire ignition and spread.
